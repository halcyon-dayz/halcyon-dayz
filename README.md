- 👋 Hi, I’m Chris. I'm a dude from the West coast but not SF or Seattle. Draw a line from one to the other and I'm in the middle somewhere. I like supporting websites that donate `time || energy || money` to `reforestation projects || wildlife preservation`. I am often caught thinking or writing about the natural beauty that exists in nature, and that which also exists among humanity. My hope is that I can lend a hand in creating some technology that is helpful or useful to the environment, the people that live in that environment, and at the very least something that *first does no harm*. 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... C/C++ and systems architecture
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Advanced Js && C/C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Writing Docs! Also web stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me ... chris@drednaut.net
